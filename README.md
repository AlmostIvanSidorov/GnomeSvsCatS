 Since this is a tutorial game, let’s design some basic gameplay for it as well:

    The goal of the game is to avoid incoming obstacles:
        The player starts on the left side of the screen.
        The obstacles enter randomly from the right and move left in a straight line.
    The player can move left, right, up, or down to avoid the obstacles.
    The player cannot move off the screen.
    The game ends either when the player is hit by an obstacle or when the user closes the window.

When he was describing software projects, a former colleague of mine used to say, “You don’t know what you do until you know what you don’t do.” With that in mind, here are some things that won’t be covered in this tutorial:

    No multiple lives
    No scorekeeping
    No player attack capabilities
    No advancing levels
    No boss characters

You’re free to try your hand at adding these and other features to your own program.

Let’s get started!
